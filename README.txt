This is the source for Trizbort's GitHub pages, ported from previous
incarnations on trizbort.genstein.net elsewhere.

This branch is consequently not recommended as a source of inspiration,
or good taste. This version was rather thrown together from ancient
pieces with minimal effort on the author's part. It's crufy enough that
a batch file replaces archaic .shtml includes, and a ".php" file is in
fact plain text. No, seriously.

For definitive versions of the Trizbort source code and documentation,
in source form, see the Trizbort repository at
http://github.com/genstein/trizbort, the master branch of this repo.
