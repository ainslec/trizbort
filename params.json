Easily confused with __satchmoz__, an incantation causing a shift in space.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nTrizbort is a simple tool which can be used to create maps for [interactive fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction).\r\n\r\nOver the years a number of styles have evolved for interactive fiction mapping. Trizbort focuses on creating maps in only one of these styles, as popularised by [Infocom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom): labelled boxes for rooms, with lines connecting them.\r\n\r\nWhether you're playing or writing interactive fiction, mapping can be invaluable. Trizbort is just one of [many mapping tools](http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXmapping-tools.html) for interactive fiction: I hope you find it useful, but you may want to check out the others too.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n\r\n- A simple point and click interface to create rooms, resize them and connect them together;\r\n- Smart\\* lines which snap to the cardinal\\*\\* points on room edges;\r\n- Rooms can be marked as dark or light; dark rooms on the map have shaded corners;\r\n- A list of objects per room, which can be \"docked\" to any room edge or placed inside the room;\r\n- Customisable colours, fonts and drawing styles;\r\n- A \"hand-drawn\" line style for that back-of-an-envelope feel;\r\n- Title, description and author text which will be saved with the map;\r\n- Export to PDF files and PNG images for posterity or printing;\r\n- Multiple selection;\r\n- Single keypress keyboard shortcuts;\r\n- An XML file format in case other tools wish to generate or read Trizbort maps.\r\n\r\n\\* Not that smart.\r\n\\*\\* More or less cardinal. In fact Trizbort adds some decidedly non-cardinal points to make things easier.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
